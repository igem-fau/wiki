<h1>iGEM Marburg - Golden Gate webinar</h1>

<div>
    <p>Team Marburg was so kind to hold a Golden Gate webinar (link) explaining the basic principle and its advantages compared to other cloning methods. In the end we got the chance to create our own Golden Gate constructs. We would like to thank team Marburg for organizing it and even though we did not use the Golden Gate system for this yearÂ´s iGEM project we all learned a lot for future projects.</p>
