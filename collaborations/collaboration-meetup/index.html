<h1>Collaboration Meetup</h1>

<div>
    <p>Cooperating with other teams is one of the fundamentals of iGEM. To promote collaborations and exchange in general already at the beginning of the iGEM year we organized our so called Collaboration Meetup from 17th to 19th May 2019 (<a href="http://igemmeetup.com/">http://igemmeetup.com/</a>) .</p>

<p>On Friday the teams from Marburg, Strasbourg, TÃ¼bingen and Vienna (links) arrived and we welcomed them with a pub quiz which included different categories like facts about Erlangen and general biological topics. Afterwards we spited the teams up to get to know each other better in the following pub crawl.
Saturday started with a breakfast and three interesting talks about immunology, epigenetics and bi-functional antibodies. After lunch our team had organized some great workshops about brewing typical Bavarian beer, Deep Learning techniques and Lab fun to prove how skilled iGEM participants really are in the lab. Additionally we offered an HTML, CSS and Wiki Freeze workshops with which we wanted to support other teams by building their own website. It was really useful for everybody who participated and we got a lot of positive feedback. Furthermore we stayed in contact with the teams and helped them with questions concerning occurring wiki problems. To get to know the other projects better and to get new impulses we were having a poster session. Since the meetup was at the beginning of our projects we were able to give each other a lot valuable input.</p>

<p>For Sunday morning we had prepared a speed dating. There were always two teams explaining their project shortly to each other and thereafter they had a certain amount of time to talk about possible collaborations. Afterwards every team rotated one spot further until all teams talked to another. All in all, it was quite successful, because the teams were more focused on how to help each other than in normal poster sessions.</p>
