<h1>iGEM Düsseldorf - Postcards</h1>

<div>
    <p>Since 2016 iGEM Duesseldorf is organizing a postcard campaign with the purpose to bring synthetic biology closer to the public. We were happy to join their this year´s campaign (link) by designing our own postcard explaining our topic. Its great to see how many teams joined this campaign: we got 48 postcards from teams worldwide!  It was overwhelming to see how well and creative all these teams explained their projects! That’s why we decided to show the postcards at the Long Night of Sciences (link) and spread it among our science interested visitors.</p>
