    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>Repeat the IPTG</p>

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<p>Check if cells are growing</p>

<p>Getting new cells and culture them properly</p>

<p><strong>CFP part:</strong></p>

<p>Cheking plates in the incubator</p>

<p>Plenty colonies in Tuner but not BL21 and STAR (Those were the &ldquo;new&rdquo; competent cells)</p>

<p>=BL21 and STAR not properly competent!!</p>

<p>New heatshock with old stock of competent bacs (STAR and BL21) acording to Evas protocol</p>

<p>HEK:</p>

<p>Check the flasks in the incubator: Live and happy ~ 50% confluent</p>

<p>Seewing of 4 x 10^6 cells in a plate (10 mL) like following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Discard medium</p></li>

<li><p>Washing with 3 mL Trypsin</p></li>

<li><p>Incubation with 3 mL trypsin</p></li>

<li><p>When cells were detached mixing with 7 mL Medium</p></li>

<li><p>Counting in neubauer chamber (total cell number 10,2 x 10^6 cells)</p></li>

<li><p>8 mL cell mix in the plate + 2 mL medium</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rest of the cells back in the flask, ad 20 mL with medium</p>

<p>E. coli:</p>

<p>Digest of pACYC184: 5µL cutsmart, 11µL DNA, 1µL Cla-I, 1µL Sal-I</p>

<p>Water was not added! (WRONG)</p>

<p>Digest of the constructs which were already digested on the 07.09. but not for 1 h just 15 min.</p>

<p>1 h digest with Cla-I and Sal-I (each 0,5µL)</p>

<p>Ligation</p>
