<li>Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample, and then mix. It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene. For example, add 500 μl of Buffer PB to 100 μl PCR sample (not including oil).</li>
<li>If pH Indicator I has been added to Buffer PB, check that the mixture’s color is yellow. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow.</li>
<li>Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.</li>
<li>To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.</li>
<li>Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. Collection tubes are reused to reduce plastic waste.</li>
<li>To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.</li>
<li>Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min. IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.</li>
<li>Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</li>
<li>To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge. IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volumes are 48 μl from 50 μl elution buffer volume and 28 μl from 30 μl elution buffer. Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. Maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C because DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent. The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.</li>
<li>If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting it up and down before loading the gel. Loading Dye contains 3 marker dyes – bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol and orange G – that facilitate estimation of DNA-migration distance and optimization of the agarose gel run time. Refer to Table 2 (page 17) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.</li>
