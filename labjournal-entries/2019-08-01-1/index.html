<strong>Calculations and Results</strong></p>

<p>Ase1 part of the vector and also part of each construct</p>

<p>-Ase1 cuts sticky ends -occurence of multimers</p>

<p>-Smallest piece is 329 kb, additinal bands due to multimers</p>

<p>-These bands can be found for every construct</p>

<p>Pvu1 cuts only 2a in two site</p>

<p>-many fragments from construct 2a</p>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: The Construct had been inserted into the vector successfully!</p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>Pvu1 was mistakingly used in an attempt to cut the insert. However, cutting site is only in 2a. Ase1 sufficient for the intepretation of the results.</p>

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<p>confirm results with PCR of the insert</p>
