<p><strong>Colony PCR</strong></p>

<p>Preparation of labled Eppis with 1 mL LB with Chloramphenicol.</p>

<p>Preparation of Mastermixes for the colony PCR with: Q5 MM, Primers, Water as followed (3 colonies of each construct):</p>

<li>​    K1: &ldquo;K1 restriction fw&rdquo; and &ldquo;K1 restriction re&rdquo;</li>
<li>​    all other constructs: &ldquo;restriction fw&rdquo; and &ldquo;restriction re&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>25 µL per colony master mix in the according PCR tube.</p>

<p>Picking of clones with a pipet tip</p>

<p>PCR program: Konstrukt amplification</p>

<p>​    modifcation: 1st step at 90°C 10 min</p>

<p>Gel electrophores (1% agarose, 130 V)</p>

<p>2 µL Loading dye was added to the 10 µL PCR and then loaded on the gel.</p>

<p>Loading scheme of the gel (2 x 14 pockets, 1mm wide):</p>

<p>First Row:</p>

<p>1 kb Ladder | K1.1 | K1.2 | K1.3 |K2a1.1 | K2a1.2 | K2a1.3 | K2b.1| K2b.2 | K2b.3 | K3a.1 | K3a.2 |   K3a.3</p>

<p>Second Row:</p>

<p>1 kb Ladder   K3b.1 | K3b.2 | K3b.3 | K4a.1 | K4a.2 | K4a.3 | K4b.1 | K4b.2 | K4b.3 | K2a2.1 | K2a2.2 | K2a.3</p>

<p><strong>Calculations and Results</strong></p>

<p>Weak bands</p>

<p>​    might be repeated with with more cycles!</p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t prepare 1 replicate in the MM, therefore the last tube had a little less volume than the others.</p>

<p>Switched poles during electrophoresis, therefore lost the first row.</p>

<p><strong>Mini Prep</strong></p>

<p>Miniprep of ON cultures of the colonies that were incubated after colony PCR (09.09.19)</p>

<p>Assessment of success using gel electrophoresis (1% gel, 130 V)</p>
