<p><em><strong>Notes</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>Before the purification the according DNA bands were cut out of the gel</li>
<li>The gel pieces were transferred into Eppendorf Reaction Tubes, which were weighed beforehand;</li>
<li>The mass of the gel pieces was determined by repeated weighing, to determine the necessary amounts of reagents

<br />

<br />

<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protocol</strong></p>

<p>Protocol of the NucleoSpin Extract Kit</p>

<p><strong>Calculations and Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reaction Tube weight (empty): K2b 1,013g K3b 1,014g K4a 1,013g K4b 1,013g</li>

<li><p>Weight of Gelfragments: K2b 0,287g K3b 0,356g K4a 0,288g K4b 0,287g</p></li>

<li><p>For each 100mg gel 300ul of NT1 buffer should be used</p></li>

<li><p>Amount of NT1 buffer:  K2b 861ul K3b 1068ul K4a 863ul K4b 861ul</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>The gel fragments were quite large; This might have a negative impact on the efficiency of the purification;</p>

<p>As the lab with the nanodrop was already closed the Concentration of the processed DNA could not be assesed at this day;</p>

<p><strong>Materials used</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>NucleoSpin Extract Kit
