<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>first we  down-centrifuged the over-night culture from K3ab</li>
<li>We then put 500µl of K3ab together with 500µl of Glycerol in the freezer at -80°C (box at the bottom of rang 12)</li>
<li>Then the Mini-Prep with the Extract gel was performed</li>
<li>The DNA was then stored at 4°C

<br />

<p><strong>Calculations and Results</strong></p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>We used 14ml overnight-culture, which was a little bit too much, because after the lysis there was a lot protein waste so we had to repeat this step several times</p>

<p><strong>Materials used</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Glycerol</li>
<li>Extract Me Kit

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Measure DNA concentrations</li>
<li>Performing a gel-electrophoresis with the isolated DNA (first cleave the DNA with restriction-enzymes)</li>
<li>Sent a part of the isolated DNA to sequencing-company</li>
