<p>Notes</p>

<p>Check XGal/IPTG/Amp+ Plates &ndash;overgrown, all colonies blue (on negative and positive plates!)
Induced the ON cultures with 0 mM, 0,33 mM and 0,5 mM IPTG;
Placed them in the incubator
Meanwhile Miniprep with 1 ml of each of the uninduced CFP pos cultures was performed.
Applied 10 µl sample + 3 µl 6xDye + 5 µl H2O to a 0.8% Agarose Gel</p>

<p>Gel:     Ladder/Bl21/Star/Tuner</p>

<p>&ndash;Tuner does not contain the desired insert. This notion is corraborated by the pellets colour.</p>
