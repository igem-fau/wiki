    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>Take Plates with negative control for measurement Part out of the incubator, colonies grew on alle of them!</p>

<p>Picked clones and prepared ON cultures with 8 ml LB-Amp, put them in the fridge until later;</p>

<p>Medium Change 1h  prior to Transfection of the HEKs, DMEM without Hepes (cells were already in Medium without Hepes);</p>

<p>Confluence ~ 70%;</p>

<p>Prepare new LB Agar for new Chloramphenicol Plates;
35 g LB Agar were weighed in and mixed thorougly with 1 l Water;</p>

<p>Autoclaved Medium;</p>

<p>Performed Calciumchlorid Transfection:</p>

<p>Perpared two  mixes:</p>

<p>A) 1 ml of 2x HBS in a 15 ml Falcon;</p>

<p>B)  DNA Mix:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Water</th>
<th>860 µl</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Plasmid</td>
<td>20 µl (1 µg/µl)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2,5 M CaCl2</td>
<td>100 µl</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2,5 mM Chloroquine</td>
<td>20 µl</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Carefully apply the DNA mix to the 2x HBS over the time of 1 min, while constantly blowing air into the HBS with a Pipette boy;</p>

<p>Vortex the resulting Mix thorougly and apply it dropwise to the Cells;</p>

<p>After the prepared Medium has cooled sufficiently added Chloamphenicol (35 mg/ml) to reach a concentration of 25 µg/ml &ndash;735 µl;</p>

<p>Poured new Chloramph Plates;
Seeded the Heatshock Samples from 25.9 that were stored in the fridge onto Chloramphenicol Plates;</p>

<p>Placed them in the Incubator;</p>

<p>Placed the earlier prepared ON cultures in the shaker;</p>

<p>Performed Medium Change 6 h post transfection with 10 ml Medium;</p>
