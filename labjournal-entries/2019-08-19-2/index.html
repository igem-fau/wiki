<p>On all of the plates the seeding worked fine and clones can be picked later on for ON cultures;

<p>The first attempt was @25 °C for 1 hour;</p>

<p>Inactivation @ 80 °C for 20 min;</p>

<p>Second attempt incubation @37 °C for 1 hour;</p>

<p>Inactivation @ 80 °C for 20 min;</p>

<p>Both of the samples were to find better conditions as the digest from 17.8.19 were not optimal;</p>

<p>25 °C is the optimal temperature for SmaI, whereas 37 °C is the optimum for the phosphatase;</p>

<p>With 1 hour incubation time also the 25 °C should be suitable for the phosphatase and likewise the 37 °C are acceptable for SmaI, given that the efficacy of the digest is lowered by approx 50% (information on the NEB site);</p>

<p>None of the Digests showed optimal results;</p>

<p>Both were looked at in an 0,8% agarose gel, each for their own.</p>

<p>The order looked like the following:</p>

<p>| 1kb DNA Ladder (5µl)| empty | Half Sample (30µl):5 µl Staining |
|&mdash; |&mdash; |&mdash; |&mdash; |&mdash; |
| 25 µl Sample|empty|Half Sample (30 µl):5 µl Staining25 µl Sample|</p>

<p>Attempt 1 of todays pUC19 digest did show a similar result to yesterdays digestion</p>

<p>Expected was one band of 2,7 kb length (see picture from virtual digest 17.8.19);</p>

<p>The suspected bands were cut out and extracted from the gel (QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit);</p>

<p>Sample 1: 0,36 g; Sample2: 0,3 g;</p>

<p>&ndash;1060 µl QG; &ndash;900 µl QG</p>

<p>Protocoll of the Kit was used, the DNA was solved in 50 µl H2O;</p>

<p>The resulting DNA was measured in the Nanodrop;</p>

<p>With these low DNA concentrations Gibson Assembly is not feasible without increasing the reaction volume substantially;<br />
Therefor one should ask one of the TAs for advise to increase the DNA concentrationin a reliable way;</p>

<p><strong>ON culture of Single Colonies from CHO-S K1, K2a, K2b</strong></p>

<p>For each of the three constructs three colonies were picked and carefully seeded in 5 ml LB-Medium (Amp+) under sterile conditions;</p>

<p>Placed in the incubator @ 37 °C 130 rpm (time approx. 18:30);</p>

<p><strong>Heatshock pSec:</strong></p>

<p>Stored pSec has a concentration of 2 µg/µl &ndash;a 1:10 dilution was performed to pipette 100 ng of vector DNA for the heatshock procedure;</p>

<p>The 100 ng of pSec vector DNA were used for 200 µl DH5a;</p>

<p>Evas&rsquo; protocoll was used;</p>

<p>A plate of LB-Agar (Amp+) was seeded and put in the incubator @ 37 °C (time approx. 18:30);</p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>Gel bands did indicate a non optimal digest &ndash;Not suspected bands and maybe also religation??;</p>

<p>The other digestion Attempt worked as bad as the first or the one from 17.8.19;</p>

<p>Not sure which of the bands is the actual cut vector as one bamd is visible at approx. 3kb, one band looks more like 2 kb and maybe there is a very thin band at 2,7 kb which would be the expected position;</p>

<p>Ask TA with the gel photo for advise and maybe also advise for a proper digestion &ndash;Might be that it was not to few but rather to much enzyme??</p>

<p>Also DNA purification from the Gel yielded only an extremly low amount of DNA &ndash;Gibson not performable;</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>ending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**</p>

<p>Take the overnight cultures of Gibson CHO K1, K2a, K2b out of the incubator</p>

<p>Take the plate from pSec out of the incubator</p>

<p>Mini-Prep of pSec &amp; freeze</p>

<p>Speak to the TA or PhD: Discuss the gel bands of the digests &amp; how to increase the concentration of pUC19 digest 2 to continue with gibson assembly</p>

<p>Gibson assembly of pUC19 and measurement part (has conc of 1000 ng in 20 µl according to TAs advice</p>

<p>Heatshock of pUC19 and measurement part in competent E.coli</p>

<p>Generate more pUC19 vector</p>
