<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gibson Assembly</strong></p>

<p>According to 2.8.19: CHO constructs and measurement part were taken up in 20 µl TE buffer. &ndash;concentration: 50ng/µl</p>

<p>concentration pSec: 26,8 ng/µl</p>

<p>using 50 ng pSec 1,86 µl</p>

<p>using insert three-fold: 150 ng ~3 µl ; used inserts: CHO K1, CHO K2a, CHO K2b, measurement part</p>

<p>also performed a positive control with the provided kit.</p>

<p>Incubated at 50 °C in thermocycler for 30mins.</p>

<p><strong>Heatshock</strong></p>

<p>performed a heatshock with the Gibson Assembly with DH5a bacteria, following Evas protocoll. Used 18 µl of the assembly samples.</p>

<p>Plated the bacteria on Amp plates and put in incubator to be continued with tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Gel electrophoresis</strong></p>

<p>prepared a 0.8% agarose gel with 0.8 g agarose in 100 ml TE buffer. microwaved and added SybrGreen after short cooling period.</p>

<p>Mixed 2 µl of DNA sample with 2 µl of DNA Purple Dye and 16 µl of water.</p>

<p>Added 7 µl DNA Ladder</p>

<p>Order: wayward DNA Ladder - empty - DNA Ladder - CHO K1 - CHO K2a - CHO K2b - Measurement Part - Positive control</p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>Nothing just DNA ladder visible on gel. Might have used not enough DNA sample?</p>

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>take plates out of incubator, pick colonies</li>
<li>find a new pUC19 vector to try</li>
</ul>
