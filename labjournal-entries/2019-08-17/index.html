<p><em><strong>Notes</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Prepare new Amp plates:</strong></p>

<p>Prepare 500ml LB-Broth with Agar (17,5 g Agar) for 19 new colony plates;</p>

<p>Autoclave the Mixture to make it sterile;</p>

<p>After a cooling phase Amp got added (500 µl &ndash;concentration: 50 µg/ml);</p>

<p>Pour the plates under sterile conditions and put them in the refrigerator @4 °C;</p>

<p>For the digestion of pUC19 with SmaI the miniprep samples were measured in the nanodrop;</p>

<p>As the measurement diverged greatly from the measurement the day before that was done right after the miniprep, but with out further purification two approaches were prepared. One with the old nanodrop results from the day before and one with the new results. It is thought that the approach from the day before won&rsquo;t have the right amount of Vector inside but it is prepared either way to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Incubate at 37°C for 1 h;</p>

<p>Inactivate at 80 °C for 20 min (80 °C necessary to inactivate the phosphatase, SmaI itself 65 °C for 20 min would be sufficient);</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of 0,8 % Agarose Gel:</strong></p>

<p>Weigh in 0,8g Agarose and solve in 100ml TAE-buffer &ndash;solve Agarose by microwaving;</p>

<p>After cooling adding of SybrGreen 7 µl;</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Single Colonies from CHO-S K1, K2a, K2b</strong></p>

<p>For each of the three constructs three colonies were picked and carefully plated under sterile conditions onto the Agar (Amp+) Plates that were earlier prepared;</p>

<p><strong>Problems faced / possible error causes</strong></p>

<p>The Gel did not show a clear enough band to extract the digested vector. This is due incubation temperature (37 °C);<br />
SmaI does only require 25 °C to cut properly and shows only 50 % performance at 37 °C;</p>

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Measurement part!: Repeat digestion (SmaI) and dephosphorylation of puc19 at 25 °C (Stored at 4 °C);</strong></li>
<li><strong>Control: Gel electrophoresis after digest;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Perform Gibson Assembly puc19 + CFP;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Check Plates seeded today (Incubator at 37 °C);</strong></li>
<li><strong>New Gibson Assembly with K1, K2a, K2b (important)</strong></li>
</ul>
