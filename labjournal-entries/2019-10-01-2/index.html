<p><em><strong>Notes</strong></em></p>

<p>Harvesting K2a and K2b supernatant, reapply 4 ml of Medium to the plates;</p>

<p>Prepared new plates for transfection;</p>

<p>Took 3 flasks with HEk Cells and collected the cells in a 50 ml Falcon after making them loose with trypsin and inactivating it again with Medum;</p>

<p>Cells were counted using a Neubauer Chamber in a 1:1 Dilution with Trypan Blue;<br />
Counted: 115/131/119 &ndash;Mean is 121,6 Cells per quadrant &ndash;Therefore 2,432*106  cells/ml;</p>

<p>Seed 4*106 cells per Plate for the transfection tomorrow (1,64 ml of the cell suspension);</p>

<p>The remaining 5,4 ml (~13*106  cells) were applied to a new cell culture flask;<br />
Everything was put in the incubator @37 Â°C, 5% Co2;</p>
