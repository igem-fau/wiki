    <ul>
<li>electroporation of pUC19 into BL21, BL21 Star</li>
<li>one H2O control in BL21 Star</li>
<li>generated own electroporation protocol in the GeneUser (&gt;Users&gt;igem&gt;igem1)</li>
<li>used 25 µL bacteria with 1 µL 1:5 diluted pUC19

<ul>
<li>should be 50 µL next time instead of 25 µL</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protocol:</strong>
1. incubate labelled agar plates in the incubator at 37 °C
2. incubate medium at 37 °C
3. thaw bacteria from -80 °C on ice
4. when bacteria are thawed, add DNA
5. keep 1 mm cuvettes on ice
6. electroporation of the bacteria with 1 µL DNA &ndash;immediately add warm medium to cuvette and mix by pipetting up and down
7. put bacteria on shaker at 37 °C for 30-60 mi at 300 rpm
8. plate them on the 37 °C warm agar plates
9. incubate the bacteria on plates ON &ndash;not too long or they will grow too much</p>
