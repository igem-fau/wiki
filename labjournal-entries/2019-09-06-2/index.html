    <p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></p>

<p>Checked the ON cultures in the Shaker &ndash;A 500 ml Aliquot was frozen away after centrifuging and getting rid of the supernatant;</p>

<p>The other 4,5 ml were spinned down in hte Megafuge for 5 min, 4000 rpm &ndash;Alle the pellets were rather small so the Samples were put into the Shaker under the same conditions for a couple more hours;</p>

<p>The ordered Primer for Restriction Overhang PCR were diluted in TE-Buffer, so that the concentration is 100 µM;</p>
