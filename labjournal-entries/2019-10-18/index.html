<p>Harvesting of the cells
Centrifuagtion at 2500 rpm for 5 min
600µL of supernatant were used for the purification via Histrap</p>

<p>Histrap Purification:
centrifuge at 4°C
open columns a quater and placing it in a 2 mL eppi
Centrifuation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Adding 600 µL Binding buffer
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Adding 600µL sample
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Washing with 600µL binding buffer
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
3x Elution step: Adding 100µL Elution buffer and centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min</p>

<p>Tag-Catcher reaction:
Adding same colume K2a and K2b and incubate them 20 min at RT
For this samples: Supernatant (SN) harvest, Elution (E) 1-3</p>

<p>Gel running :</p>

<p>at 130V for 1 h with following pipetting scheme</p>

<p>Gel1
M, SN K1, SN K2a, SN K2b, SN K2ab, E1 K1, E1 K2a, E1 K2b, E1 K2ab, E2 K1, E2 K2a, E2 K2b, E2 K2ab</p>

<p>Gel 2
M, SN K1, SN K2a, SN K2b, SN K2ab, E3 K1, E3 K2a, E3 K2b, E3 K2ab</p>

<p>Marker 5µL, Samples 20µL (10µL sample+10µL loading dye)
After loading dye adding samples were cooked for 2 min at 95°C except the SN samples of the gel 2</p>

<p>Blotting:
Both gels were blotted semidry for 1:23 h at 130mA</p>

<p>Blocking:
Membranes were blocked for 1h 45 with 10% milkpowdersolution</p>

<p>Primary Ab:
2 washing steps with PBST
anti-Histag ab was diluted 1:2000 in 10mL 10% milkpowdersolution and added to the membrane
Incubation overnight at 4°C</p>
