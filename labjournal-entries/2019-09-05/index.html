    <p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></p>

<p>ON Plates in the incubator were checked. The Control plate with only cut vector had 4 very small colonies on it. Whereas all Plates with Vector + Insert (pUC19 + CFP) had much higher numbers. Comparing the plates, the Gel Ex. Plate 1:5 had the least amount and within the PCR Plates a nice gradient was visible. The higher the Vector: Insert ratio was, the larger was the number of colonies.</p>

<p>With the fluorescence microscope of the AG Behrens the plates were screened for positive clones.</p>

<p>Number of CFp pos. clones was rather low &lt;10 %, positive clones were marked and later on picked to set up ON cultures;</p>

<p>Incubated ON cultures @ 37 °C, 230 rpm;</p>

<p>The ON cultures in the shaker were split. A 500 µl Aliquot was stored at -20 °C after spinning down the cells.
The other 4,5 ml were spinned down in the Megafuge (Mouse Lab), Miniprep not performed due to the low efficycy of the better ligation approach, so it is to be assumed that these clones are all negative;</p>

<p>Sequencing data was analyzed &ndash;all the sent in clones seem to be positive</p>
