    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>Checked the Plates in the Incubator;</p>

<p>The Cells with the E.  coli Restriction constructs were seeded on the wrong plates AMp+ Plates instead of CAM plates;</p>

<p>The Cells with the Measurement Part (CFP) have grown nicely; Most colonies grew with the Tuner strain;</p>

<p>2l New LB Medium with 20g LB powder per Liter were prepared and autoclaved;</p>

<p>New Heatshock with the Rest of the Ligation samples (15 µl) into Tuner;</p>

<p>200 µl of the Heatshock samples were plated on CAM+ Plates and Placed in the incubator @ 37 °C; (Rest stored @ 4 °C)</p>

<p>Made 3 ON cultures with LB Amp+ (300 ml) one for each of the Measurement Part Plates (BL21, Tuner, Star);</p>

<p>Put them in the Shaker @ 37 °C, 230 rpm</p>

<p><strong>Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prepare new competent cells (BL21, Star, Tuner, DH5a);</p></li>

<li><p>Check Plates in the Incubator and prepare cultures &ndash;Mini Prep;</p></li>

<li><p>Check Cultures in the Shaker and prepare for CFP Measuring;</p></li>
</ul>
