<li>Control gel:

<ul>
<li>used 1% agarose gel for samples of the overhang PCR and the cut vector</li>
<li>run gel at 120 V for 1 h</li>
</ul></li>
<li>purification of the cut vector with <strong>Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit:</strong></li>

<p>..1. Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel, taking care to trim excess agarose.Transfer to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and weigh the gel slice. Minimize exposure to UV light.
..2. Add 4 volumes of Gel Dissolving Buffer to the gel slice (e.g., 400 μl buffer per 100 μl or 100 mg agarose).
..3. Incubate the sample between 37-55°C (typically 50°C), vortexing periodically until the gel slice is completely dissolved (generally 5-10 minutes). For DNA fragments 8 kb, an additional 1.5 volumes of water should be added after the slice is dissolved to mitigate the tighter binding of larger pieces of DNA (e.g., 100 μl gel slice: 400 μl Gel Dissolving Buffer: 150 μl water).
..4. Insert column into collection tube and load sample onto the column. Spin for 1 minute, then discard flow-through.
..5. Re-insert column into collection tube. Add 200 μl DNA Wash Buffer and spin for 1 minute. Discarding flow-through is optional.
..6. Repeat step 5.
..7. Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Use care to ensure that the tip of the column does not come into contact with the flow-through. If in doubt, re-spin for 1 minute.
..8. Add ≥ 6 μl of DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix. Wait for 1 minute, and spin for 1 minute to elute DNA. Typical elution volumes are 6-20 μl. Nuclease-free water (pH 7-8.5) can also be used to elute the DNA. Yield may slightly increase if a larger volume of DNA Elution Buffer is used, but the DNA will be less concentrated. For larger size DNA (≥ 10 kb), heating the elution buffer to 50°C prior to use can improve yield.</p>

<ul>
<li>measurement of purified vector: 4.9 ng/µL</li>
<li>storage of purified cut vector at -20 °C</li>

<li><p>digestion of purified cut vector with EcoRV-HF enzyme</p></li>

<li><p>run gel with samples of the overhang PCR of K1, K2a, K3a from the previous day, the digested vector and uncut vector as control</p></li>

<li><p>extraction of the digested vector of the gel, store at 4 °C</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problems faced:</strong>
* Control gel was negative, only K3a was visible in the overhang PCR
* Gel for purification was empty (broken slide), had to be repeated
* Second gel also negative except for K3a</p>
