<li>thawed stock bacteria on ice</li>
<li>inocculated 2 25 µL of each strain (Tuner and DH5alpha) in 100 mL LB medium and incubated for 1:45 h until OD600 was 0.4-0.6</li>
<li>not much 10 % glycerol available so the two cultures of each strain have been pooled and washed together</li>

<li><p>frozen in 50 µL aliquots</p></li>

<li><p>modification of used protocol: 8.7 % glycerol used instead of 10 %</p></li>
